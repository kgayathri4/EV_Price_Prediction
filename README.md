🔋 Electric Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning & Generative AI

🧠 Overview

This project aims to predict the price of electric vehicles (EVs) based on their technical specifications such as battery capacity, efficiency, range, and performance metrics.

The model helps manufacturers, analysts, and buyers estimate EV prices accurately using machine learning techniques.

This project was developed as part of an internship focusing on the application of data science and generative AI concepts to real-world sustainability problems.

📦 Dataset

Source: Kaggle — Electric Vehicle Specifications and Prices
Author: Fatih Ilhan

The dataset contains details for over 360 EVs, including:

🔋 Battery capacity (kWh)

⚡ Efficiency (Wh/km)

⏱ Fast charge speed (km/h)

💶 Price (EUR)

🛣 Range (km)

🚗 Top speed (km/h)

⚙ Acceleration (0–100 km/h)


After cleaning missing and invalid entries, 309 records were used for model training.

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Steps performed in the notebook / script:

1. Load the dataset using pandas

df = pd.read_csv('EV_cars.csv')


2. Inspect and clean missing values

Dropped rows where price or essential features were missing.



3. Renamed columns for consistency:

'Price.DE.' → 'Price'

'acceleration..0.100.' → 'Acceleration_0_100'



4. Selected useful features

['Battery', 'Efficiency', 'Fast_charge', 'Range', 'Top_speed', 'Acceleration_0_100']


5. Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

🤖 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Regressor

Why Random Forest?
It handles nonlinear relationships, is robust to outliers, and works well with tabular data.


Training

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Evaluation Metrics

Metric	Value	Meaning

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	~ €8,389	On average, the model’s predictions differ by this much
R² Score	0.90	Model explains ~90% of price variance


✅ Interpretation: The model has strong predictive performance and generalizes well.
